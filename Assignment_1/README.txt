For Question 3, the code is designed to run on "Ionosphere.data.txt". The error values (stopping criteria) for each iteration are printed out. The configuration is k=2 and max_iter=20. 
Run the code "Assignment_1_Q_3.R" to get the error values.

For Question 4, there are two R files one for Ionosphere and one for Ringnorm. Each of the code runs for 20 iterations with k varying from 2 to 5. 
     "Assignment_1_Q_4_Ionosphere.R" - Run this code to get the plot presented in the pdf. It gives us a plot of k(X-axis) values and error (Y-axis) values
     "Assignment_1_Q_4_Ringnorm.R"   - Run this code to get the plot presented in the pdf. It gives us a plot of k(X-axis) values and error (Y-axis) values 

For Question 5, there are two R files one for Ionosphere and one for Ringnorm. Each of the code runs for 20 iterations with k varying from 2 to 5. 
     "Assignment_1_Q_5_Ionosphere.R" - Run this code to get the plot presented in the pdf. It gives us a plot of k(X-axis) values and SSE (Y-axis) values
     "Assignment_1_Q_5_Ringnorm.R"   - Run this code to get the plot presented in the pdf. It gives us a plot of k(X-axis) values and SSE (Y-axis) values 


Extra Credit:

For Question 1, run the code "Assignment_1_Extra_1.R" to get the error plot for breast cancer data.

For Question 2, run the code "Assignment_1_Extra_2.R" to get the SSE plot for breast cancer data.
